# XVA1-hardware-editor
A copy of the physical XVA1 hardware editor by MacMannes

I took the unfinished (due to illness) XVA1 hardware editor by MacMannes and doubled the displays and encoders and added a save facility for your edits.

It runs on a Teensy 3.6 and the rest of the hardware is similar to the original

It's not completed due to the war in my country but is more functional than the original except for the envelope displays

If it receives a program changes over MIDI and sends them onto the XVA1 synth over serial to call up the patch and recall the data into the editor.

Lots of things to improve on in the future in more peaceful times.
